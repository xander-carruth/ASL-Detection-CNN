We created a Convolutional Neural Network which analyzes images to predict what letter a person's hands are showing in American Sign Language. We generated our own American Sign Language test set and analyzed how the neural network performed on a harder to identify dataset by adding various modifications to the dataset. For more information on this project, please see [this document](ASL%20Detection%20Analysis.pdf).
